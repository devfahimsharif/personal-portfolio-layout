                <p>Hi, I'm Fahim, a 5+ years-old Developer from Bangladesh with a Passion for Coding and Technology. I have a keen interest in Game Development, Web Applications, and Automation Scripts. In my free time, I enjoy working on Personal Projects, Contributing to open-source, and exploring new Programming Languages. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to collaborate with other developers. If you're interested in working together or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out. I love connecting with fellow developers and sharing knowledge, so don't hesitate to drop me a message.</p>

                <article>
                    The Animated Calculator is an interactive web-based tool that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with smooth visual animations for button clicks, number transitions, and results display.Built with HTML5, CSS3 animations/transitions, and JavaScript, this project enhances the traditional calculator experience by adding engaging UI effects such as button hover glow, result fade-in, and sliding number animations.The main goal of this project is to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS animations, while creating a user-friendly interface that feels modern and responsive.
